    <!-- adding my own paragraph about the product to further promote it -->
    <p>This keyboard I received from Amazon has been a splice of luxury. It took exactly 3 days <br>
        and two hours to get to my door, and it's been a privilege to own. You (who is reading this) <br>
        should get this too. <br>
